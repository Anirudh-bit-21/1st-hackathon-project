# GLA Placement Prep Hub

This project is a comprehensive, AI-powered web application designed to help GLA University students prepare for job placements. It features a public landing page, a full user dashboard, and multiple tools driven by the Google Gemini AI to simulate interviews, generate coding problems, and provide company-specific preparation roadmaps.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the main landing page.
2.  Click "Login" to navigate to the `auth.html` page.
3.  Use the following hard-coded credentials to log in:

    * **User ID:** `shahvez693@gmail.com`
    * **Password:** `Shahvez1213`

4.  After logging in, you will be redirected to the `main.html` dashboard, where you can access all the features.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: AI Features Require an API Key

The core features of this application (AI Mock Interview, AI Roadmaps, AI Problem Generator, and the GLAI Assistant) **will not work** without a valid Google Gemini API key.

You must get your own API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and paste it into the following files:

* `mock.html`
* `main.html`
* `codepractice.html`

In each file, find the JavaScript variable named `API_KEY` and replace the placeholder value with your own key.

```javascript
// Find this line in the <script> tag of mock.html, main.html, and codepractice.html
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE";
```

AI Coding Problem Generator (codepractice.html): Creates custom practice sets of LeetCode and HackerRank problems based on your chosen programming language (Python, Java, C++) and difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

AI Assistant (main.html): A "GLAI Assistant" chatbot (also powered by Gemini) that can answer technical doubts and explain computer science concepts.

User Dashboard (main.html): A central hub to access all preparation tools and see a welcome message.

Profile Page (profile.html): A dedicated page to view user stats, activity summary, and personal information.

Modern UI: Fully responsive design built with Tailwind CSS, including a dark/light mode toggle.
